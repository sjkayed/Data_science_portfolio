This project uses car features to predict normalized losses, the average loss for insuring a car.
Models are built using the K nearest neighbor algorithm, and the effect of varying features and number of clusters is explored.
Models are evaluated via root mean square error calculations and the model with the lowest RMSE is identified.
Done through Dataquest.io course
